<p>Coming to an RPM based distribution near you!  This repository of penetration testing tools will be a lightweight distribution and based strictly on tools that have been used and tested to be functional and effective.  Each and every tool is maintained by us and monitored for updates made by the original developers.  Below is a list of RPM based distributions we have tested our current beta repository and found working at this time, if you would like to see your RPM based distribution added to this list please feel free to leave us a message!  Stay tuned for updates.
